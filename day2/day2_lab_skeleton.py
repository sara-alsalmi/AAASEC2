# DAY 2 LAB — SKELETON: Build a Multi-Agent Research Team
# ============================================================
# Fill in every TODO. Don't open the solution (day2_lab_solution.py)
# until you pass the self-check at the bottom.
#
# WHAT CHANGES FROM DAY 1 — read this table twice:
#
#   Day 1 (single agent)              Day 2 (multi-agent)
#   ─────────────────────             ─────────────────────────────
#   nodes = Python functions          nodes = LLM agents w/ personas
#   routing = your if/else            routing = supervisor LLM decides
#   one prompt for everything         one system prompt PER agent
#   tools available everywhere        tools SCOPED (only researcher
#                                       can search the web)
#   loop = quality-score retry        loop = critic sends draft back
#                                       to writer for revision
#
# What does NOT change: State + Nodes + Edges. A multi-agent system
# is STILL just a StateGraph. If you can build Day 1, you can build
# this — the new ideas are personas, the supervisor, and guardrails.
#
# The system you're building (the SUPERVISOR pattern):
#
#              ┌──────────── supervisor ─────────────┐
#              │       (LLM decides who's next)      │
#     ┌────────┼───────────┬───────────┬─────────────┤
#     ↓        ↓           ↓           ↓             ↓
#  researcher  analyst    writer     critic       FINISH
#     │        │           │           │             ↓
#     └────────┴───────────┴───────────┘            END
#          (every worker reports back to the supervisor)
#
# Recommended reading BEFORE you start (~25 min):
#   1. Multi-agent concepts (architectures, supervisor pattern):
#      https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/multi-agent
#   2. Refresh: conditional branching + loops (you need both again):
#      https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/use-graph-api#conditional-branching
#   3. Structured output (the supervisor's decision is structured!):
#      https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/structured-output
#
# Setup: same as Day 1 — `uv sync`, keys in .env, or USE_FAKE=1.

import os
import operator
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Annotated, List, Literal
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from dotenv import load_dotenv
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

# TODO STEP 0 — same imports as Day 1:
# StateGraph, START, END from langgraph.graph

MAX_REVISIONS = 2      # cap on writer↔critic loops
MAX_TURNS = 12         # cap on total supervisor decisions


# ============================================================
# STEP 1 — SHARED STATE: the team's "blackboard"
# ============================================================
# Day 1's state was a data PIPELINE (each field filled once, in
# order). Day 2's state is a BLACKBOARD: every agent reads all of
# it and writes only its own section; the supervisor reads it to
# decide who goes next.
#
# Define a TypedDict with:
#   task (str)
#   research_notes  <- List[str], APPEND-ONLY (which reducer? Day 1!)
#   analysis (str), draft (str), critique (str)
#   revision_count (int), turn_count (int)
#   next_agent (str)   <- the supervisor writes its decision HERE
#   execution_logs     <- append-only, same as Day 1
#
# ASK YOURSELF: why must research_notes append but draft overwrite?
# What would happen to the revision loop if draft used operator.add?

class TeamState(TypedDict):
    task: str
    # TODO: add the remaining 8 keys (two use Annotated + operator.add)
    pass


# ============================================================
# STEP 2 — STRUCTURED ROUTING DECISION
# ============================================================
# Day 1: structured output produced a quality SCORE.
# Day 2: structured output produces a ROUTING DECISION — this is
# the trick that turns an LLM into a supervisor. Literal[...] means
# the model CANNOT invent an agent that doesn't exist.
#
# WHERE TO LOOK: structured-output docs (same page as Day 1).

class RouterDecision(BaseModel):
    """The supervisor's choice of who acts next."""
    next_agent: Literal["researcher", "analyst", "writer", "critic", "FINISH"]
    reason: str = Field(description="One sentence explaining the choice")


# ============================================================
# STEP 3 — ONE LLM, FOUR PERSONAS (+ tools scoped per agent)
# ============================================================
# A multi-agent "team" doesn't need four models — it needs four
# SYSTEM PROMPTS. (In production you might also vary the model per
# agent: cheap model for the critic, big one for the writer.)
#
# TODO:
# 1. Write a PERSONAS dict: role -> system prompt, for
#    "researcher", "analyst", "writer", "critic".
#    Each persona must say what the agent DOES and what it MUST NOT
#    do (e.g. the researcher never analyzes). Boundaries between
#    agents live in the prompts — write them sharp.
# 2. Create llm (ChatOpenAI + OpenRouter, exactly like Day 1) and
#    search_tool (TavilySearch(max_results=4)).
# 3. supervisor_llm = llm.with_structured_output(RouterDecision)
# 4. Helper: run_persona(role, user_content) → invoke llm with
#    [SystemMessage(PERSONAS[role]), HumanMessage(user_content)]
#    and return response.content.
#
# TOOL SCOPING: only the researcher node may call search_tool.
# That's a deliberate design decision, not a limitation — ask
# yourself what could go wrong if the critic could search.

PERSONAS = {
    # TODO: four personas
}

# TODO: llm, search_tool, supervisor_llm, run_persona


# ============================================================
# STEP 4 — THE SUPERVISOR NODE (the piece Day 1 didn't have)
# ============================================================
# The supervisor node must:
# 1. Increment turn_count.
# 2. Build a STATUS SUMMARY of the blackboard (which sections are
#    filled? what does the critique say? how many revisions?).
#    Don't dump the full text of everything — the supervisor needs
#    STATUS, not content. (Why? Think tokens and attention.)
# 3. Ask supervisor_llm for a RouterDecision.
# 4. GUARDRAILS — never trust an LLM to terminate a loop:
#      a) if turn_count > MAX_TURNS → force FINISH
#      b) if the LLM picks writer/critic but revision_count >=
#         MAX_REVISIONS and a draft exists → force FINISH
#    This is Day 1's iteration cap wearing a new hat. Same lesson:
#    the LLM proposes, YOUR CODE disposes.
# 5. Return {"next_agent": ..., "turn_count": ..., "execution_logs": [...]}
#
# WHERE TO LOOK: multi-agent docs → "Supervisor" section.

def supervisor_node(state: TeamState):
    # TODO
    pass


# ============================================================
# STEP 5 — WORKER AGENT NODES
# ============================================================
# Each worker: read the blackboard → act in persona → return a
# PARTIAL update with ONLY its own section (Day 1 rule, unchanged).

def researcher_node(state: TeamState):
    """Search the web (ONLY this agent may), condense to notes."""
    # TODO:
    # 1. results = search_tool.invoke({"query": state["task"]})["results"]
    # 2. Format results into a raw text block (title, content, url)
    # 3. notes = run_persona("researcher", f"Task ...\n\nSearch results:\n{raw}")
    # 4. return {"research_notes": [notes], "execution_logs": [...]}
    #    ^ note the LIST — research_notes is append-only!
    pass


def analyst_node(state: TeamState):
    """Turn raw notes into analysis."""
    # TODO: run_persona("analyst", ...) → {"analysis": ..., "execution_logs": [...]}
    pass


def writer_node(state: TeamState):
    """Write the draft — or REVISE it if a critique is present."""
    # TODO:
    # 1. revising = critique exists and starts with "REVISE"
    # 2. Build the prompt; when revising, include the previous draft
    #    AND the critique so the writer knows what to fix.
    # 3. return {"draft": ...,
    #            "critique": "",   <- WHY reset this? (see self-check)
    #            "revision_count": +1 only when revising,
    #            "execution_logs": [...]}
    pass


def critic_node(state: TeamState):
    """Review the draft against the research notes."""
    # TODO: run_persona("critic", ...) → the persona replies either
    # "APPROVED" or "REVISE: <fixes>". Store it in critique.
    pass


# ============================================================
# STEP 6 — ROUTING FUNCTION + WIRE THE GRAPH
# ============================================================
# The conditional-edge function is now TRIVIAL — it just reads the
# supervisor's decision:
#
#     def route_from_supervisor(state) -> str:
#         return state["next_agent"]
#
# Compare with Day 1, where all decision logic lived inside
# quality_router. The intelligence MOVED from the edge into a node.
#
# Wiring checklist:
# 1. add all five nodes
# 2. START → supervisor
# 3. add_conditional_edges("supervisor", route_from_supervisor,
#        {"researcher": "researcher", "analyst": "analyst",
#         "writer": "writer", "critic": "critic", "FINISH": END})
# 4. EVERY worker gets an edge BACK to supervisor — the
#    hub-and-spoke shape that defines the supervisor pattern.
#    (A for-loop over the four worker names is idiomatic.)

# TODO: route_from_supervisor + graph wiring


# ============================================================
# STEP 7 — COMPILE, VISUALIZE, RUN
# ============================================================
# Same as Day 1: compile with InMemorySaver, print the Mermaid
# diagram (it should look like a STAR, not Day 1's chain), stream
# with stream_mode="values" and a thread_id, print the final draft.
#
# EXPERIMENT 1: set MAX_REVISIONS = 0. What happens to quality?
# EXPERIMENT 2: delete guardrail (a) and make the critic always
#   say REVISE. Watch the turn cap save you — then delete guardrail
#   (b) too and meet your old friend GraphRecursionError.
# EXPERIMENT 3: swap the analyst's persona for a terrible one
#   ("you are vague and generic"). How far does the damage spread
#   through the team? This is why persona boundaries matter.

# ============================================================
# SELF-CHECK before you look at the solution
# ============================================================
# [ ] I can explain the supervisor pattern in one sentence
# [ ] My routing function reads state — the DECISION was made in a node
# [ ] research_notes appends; draft overwrites; I know why each
# [ ] The writer RESETS critique — I can explain what breaks if not
#     (hint: what does the supervisor see on the turn after a revision?)
# [ ] Only researcher_node touches search_tool
# [ ] My supervisor has BOTH guardrails, and I triggered EXPERIMENT 2
# [ ] My Mermaid diagram is a star: supervisor in the middle
# [ ] I can name one task where Day 1's single agent is the BETTER
#     design (multi-agent is not free: more calls, more latency,
#     more places to break — coordination must earn its cost)
#
# Stuck? Debugging order that works:
#   1. stream_mode="updates" — watch each supervisor decision + reason
#   2. print the status summary your supervisor_node builds — is the
#      LLM seeing an accurate picture of the blackboard?
#   3. check your conditional-edge dict covers ALL five decisions
#   4. only THEN open day2_lab_solution.py
